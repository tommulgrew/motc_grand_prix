"Mot's Grand Prix.sh" is a bash script for running Mot's Grand Prix in 
Portmaster.
This is useful for running the game on Linux based mobile devices (Anbernic 
etc) as Portmaster ensures the buttons and sound works, and handles integration 
with the game launcher.

You will need a device with Portmaster installed, and the ability to copy files 
onto that device.

Instructions:

1. Download linux_all.zip from 
   https://tommulgrew.itch.io/mots-grand-prix-remastered
2. Find the Portmaster folder on your device (e.g. on mine it's .../roms/ports)
3. Create a sub-folder in the Portmaster folder named "mot_grandprix" and unzip 
   the linux_all.zip files into there
4. Copy "Mot's Grand Prix.sh" into the main Portmaster folder (not the 
   subfolder)

Refresh your games list on your device.

Note: This is not a proper Portmaster release as it lacks metadata files, 
screenshots, artwork etc. It's just the minimum required to get the game to 
run.
