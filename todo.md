Fixed
=====

- DONE Quad edge issues
    - DONE Single pixel gap
    - DONE Single pixel texture wrap around
- DONE - "Pico-8" text on right barrier is mirrored
    - Although in original game text on left barrier is mirrored!
      Will just make it match original to start with. Rest can be left as a future enhancement.
- DONE Gaps in canopy in Monza track. Missing some logic to elongate models? Or is model wrong?

- Shoulder things not generating correctly. Seems to miss out the middle of the curve?!
